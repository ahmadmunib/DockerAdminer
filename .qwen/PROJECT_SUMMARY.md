# Project Summary

## Overall Goal
Configure UFW firewall rules to restrict access to PostgreSQL port 5432, allowing only the Adminer Docker container to connect instead of allowing all incoming connections.

## Key Knowledge
- Docker Compose project with an Adminer service running on a custom bridge network called `local_network`
- Adminer container is named "adminer" and is assigned IP address `172.22.0.2` on the `172.22.0.0/16` subnet
- The Docker network gateway is `172.22.0.1`
- Currently port 5432 is open to all incoming connections via UFW, which needs to be restricted
- To allow only the Adminer container, UFW rules should permit traffic from `172.22.0.0/16` subnet

## Recent Actions
- Inspected the Adminer Docker container to retrieve network configuration details
- Examined the Docker network configuration to confirm IP address ranges
- Determined that Adminer container has IP address `172.22.0.2` on the `172.22.0.0/16` network
- Identified the appropriate UFW rule changes needed to restrict access to PostgreSQL port

## Current Plan
1. [DONE] Identify the IP address of the Adminer container
2. [DONE] Determine the Docker network subnet range (`172.22.0.0/16`)
3. [TODO] Remove current UFW rule that allows all incoming connections to port 5432
4. [TODO] Add UFW rule to allow access to port 5432 only from the Docker network subnet `172.22.0.0/16`
